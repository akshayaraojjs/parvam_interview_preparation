Why React Framework?
    React is a JavaScript library used to build modern, fast, and interactive web applications.

Simple Explanation:
    Without React, you’d have to manually update parts of a webpage using JavaScript every time something changes — which quickly becomes messy.

    React makes it easier by:
    1. Breaking UI into Components
        → You can create small, reusable pieces (like Navbar, Button, Card) and combine them to build big apps.
    2. Automatic Updates
        → React updates only what changes on the screen — not the whole page (using a “Virtual DOM”).
        → This makes apps faster and more efficient.
    3. Reusable Code
        → Write once, use it anywhere. Helps build big projects cleanly.
    4. Ecosystem Support
        → Has lots of ready-to-use libraries, tools, and a big community.

In short:
    React helps you build dynamic, component-based web apps faster, cleaner, and easier to maintain.

Why Vite?
    Vite (pronounced *“veet”*) is a build tool and development server — used to run and bundle React (and other) projects.

Simple Explanation:
    Earlier tools like *Create React App* were slow because they recompiled the whole app every time you made a change.

    Vite fixes that.

    Vite is used because it’s:
    1. Very Fast 🚀
        → Uses modern browser features to start instantly and update changes in milliseconds.
    2. Simple Setup ⚙️
        → You can create a React app in seconds using
        npm create vite@latest my-app --template react
    3. Hot Reloading 🔄
        → When you edit a file, Vite refreshes only that part of the page instantly (no full reload).
    4. Optimized Build 📦
        → Vite uses Rollup internally to create super-fast production builds.

In short:
    Vite makes developing and building React apps much faster and smoother.

npm create vite@latest app-name --template react

React - JavaScript based framework (Dynamically updating the data)

Vite - Plugin or Library

jsx - JavaScript XML (To write HTML from JS) (Virtual DOM) (Automatically updates the HTML components based on the events occurred)

DOM - Document Object Model

Traditional DOM - Document -> HTML 
                                |
                            head        body
                            |           |
                        title, link     h1, p, table

XML - Extended Markup Language

src - 
    assets - To store the images, css files and js files
    App.jsx - Brain of React App (Controller of all the components)
    main.jsx - To Link the React App with index.html

index.html - Main file which is going to show the output

package.json - Dependency Manager

vite.config.js - Vite Configuration settings

npm - node package Manager

npm install package-name

npm install bootstrap

To run the React app:

npm run dev

react port: 3000

vite port: 5173

localhost: Environment where we are working

http://localhost:5173

node_modules folder contains all the Dependency libraries or files

To get the node_modules, we need to run npm install

All the file names should be given in PascalCase

navbar => Navbar

student form => StudentForm


Basic Structure:

// Header file
import React from "react";

// function based approach
function Header(){

    // return the HTML components
    return(

    );
}

// exporting the component to reuse in anothe file
export default Header;

For navigation purpose, we need a Dependency called React-Router-Dom

npm install react-router-dom

We have some default css styles in index.css, we can remove it if it is not neccessary

class attribute will become className

class => className

If we want to use Bootstrap in React App, we need to import the CSS & JS files

We will link it in the main.jsx
